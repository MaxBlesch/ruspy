The paper can be replicated with this [notebook](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ruspy/blob/master/replication/Red%20Buttons.ipynb), which first processes the data and afterwards runs the Nested Fixpoint Algorithm introduced in the paper.

Furthermore, after running the data processing the descriptives in Table IIa and IIb can be replicated with this [notebook](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ruspy/blob/master/replication/replicate%20descriptives.ipynb).
