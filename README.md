# Optimal Replacement of GMC Bus Engines: An Empirical Model of Harold Zurcher

This repository contains code to replicate some descriptives and results of
> Rust, J. (1987). [Optimal Replacement of GMC Bus Engines: An empirical model of Harold Zurcher.](https://doi.org/10.2307/1911259) *Econometrica*, Vol. 55, No.5, 999-1033. 

After running the data processing, the descriptives in Table IIa and IIb of the paper can be replicated using this [notebook](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ruspy/blob/master/replication/replicate%20descriptives.ipynb).

At the Hackathon on 30.01. I presented some speed devolpment in my code. Here is the link to the old [notebook](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ruspy/blob/master/development_speed/timing_old_code.ipynb) and this leads to the new [code](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ruspy/blob/master/development_speed/timing_new_code.ipynb). Both notebooks replicate the paper for Group 4.

All jupyter notebooks from above can be executed in an online envoirement provided by [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/OpenSourceEconomics/ruspy/master).
