# Optimal Replacement of GMC Bus Engines: An Empirical Model of Harold Zurcher

This repository contains code to replicate some descriptives and results of
> Rust, J. (1987). [Optimal Replacement of GMC Bus Engines: An empirical model of Harold Zurcher.](https://doi.org/10.2307/1911259) *Econometrica*, Vol. 55, No.5, 999-1033. 

After running the data processing, the descriptives in Table IIa and IIb of the paper can be replicated using this [notebook](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ruspy/blob/master/replication/replicate%20descriptives.ipynb).

Furthermore, the parameters of Zurcher's decision rule are estimated in this [notebook](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ruspy/blob/master/replication/Red%20Buttons.ipynb), which contains a python implementation of the well known Nested Fixpoint Algorithm.
